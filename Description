Here we have taken a data  of Canada per capita income from years 1970 to 2016
First we will clean the data and keep in table format 
If any column have any NULL value then .  Fill NULL values with median value of a column
Then represents the data in scatter plot 
We will apply  machine learning algorithms like  linear regression with single variable 
Linear regression: Y = mx + b
Here percapitaincome is dependent variable and year is independent variable 
At last we can predict the percapitaincome 
To predict house percapitaincome we must give data 'year'
That predicted value is not perfectly correct , but it can make proper solution
